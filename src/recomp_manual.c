/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

 *   +0x1B0/+0x1B4  picture width/height    +0x1B8/+0x1BC  Y/UV stride
 *   +0x21C/+0x220/+0x224  Y/U/V offsets in a frame buffer
 *   +0x244  buffer being decoded   +0x254  last decoded (sub_0026144D's
 *           output, and the reference) -- swapped after every frame
 * Planes are bottom-up with a 48 (Y) / 24 (UV) pixel border for motion
 * vectors past the edge. The movie player (sub_0025F909) then passes +0x254
 * on to be drawn.
 *
 * Lifted, this is most of the CPU time of a movie on the Switch, so by
 * default FFmpeg decodes the frame (src/movie_vp6.c) into +0x244 and the
 * buffers are swapped as the original does. The border is not filled in:
 * only On2's own motion compensation read it. NFSU2_NATIVE_VP6=0 runs the
